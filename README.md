 # Pygame

Pygame is a third-party module designed for creating 2D games with Python. It has a very simple and intuitive syntax that allows us to create powerful games quickly. Pygame uses surfaces for drawing, meaning that whenever we want to draw something to the screen, it must be converted to a surface. There are many methods and functions within Pygame that can do this easily for us.

## Installation

Installing Pygame can be as easy as:

1. Opening your command prompt.
2. Typing the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
